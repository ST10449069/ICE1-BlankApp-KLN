My experince during the setup was a complicated one because I had to restart my app three times because the first time, the app was giving me an error when I tried running and I had to consult with my lecture, the second time, my app didn't want to run thought I had figured out where I went wrong in the first app and I delete both apps, third time is a charm and my app did run successefully. 

Setup teps:
I created a blank typescript template and followed the necessary steps afterward. 
I went to App.tsx and changed the text to the text that was required to be entered. 
I ran the app on Bluestacks and it was running successefully without errors.
